Continue implementing CQLAI cluster metadata manager.

I am implementing a cluster metadata manager in internal/cluster/ package that wraps Apache Cassandra gocql driver's metadata capabilities.

REQUIREMENTS:
Read claude-notes/cluster-metadata-requirements.md for complete requirements.

CONTEXT:
This is needed to unblock 34 CQL test scenarios that require schema awareness (primary key validation, BATCH cross-partition detection, static column semantics).

RESUME FILE:
Read RESUME_PROMPT_CLUSTER_METADATA.md for complete context and implementation plan.

BRANCH:
feature/mcp_datatypes

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
1. Read requirements in claude-notes/cluster-metadata-requirements.md
2. Design package based on requirements
3. Implement internal/cluster/ package
4. Write 5 integration tests (schema retrieval, refresh, CREATE/DROP, composite keys, clustering keys)
5. All integration tests must pass
6. Integrate into query planner
7. Verify first schema-dependent test works

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
All 5 integration tests pass, schema lookups work, can validate primary keys in planner.
