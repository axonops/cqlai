# CQL Syntax Support in cqlai

## SELECT Statement Support Analysis

### Core SELECT Syntax Specification:
```sql
select_statement::= SELECT [ JSON | DISTINCT ] ( select_clause | '*' )
    FROM table_name
    [ WHERE where_clause ]
    [ GROUP BY group_by_clause ]
    [ ORDER BY ordering_clause ]
    [ PER PARTITION LIMIT (integer | bind_marker) ]
    [ LIMIT (integer | bind_marker) ]
    [ ALLOW FILTERING ]
```

### Execution Model:

1. **Pass-through execution**: The `VisitSelect_` function in `visitor_stubs.go:40-89` takes the complete SELECT query text via `ctx.GetText()` and passes it directly to Cassandra via `v.session.Query(query).Iter()`.

2. **No query modification**: The implementation doesn't parse or modify the SELECT statement - it sends the raw CQL to Cassandra, ensuring 100% syntax compatibility.

3. **Result handling**: Results are collected into a 2D string array with headers, properly handling null values.

### Tab Completion Implementation:

The enhanced `getSelectCompletions` function in `completion.go:207-519` provides:

1. **Context-aware suggestions**: Tracks which clauses have been used to suggest only valid next options
2. **Column name caching**: Fetches and caches actual column names from system_schema
3. **Smart operator suggestions**: After column names in WHERE clause
4. **Function support**: Suggests CQL functions like COUNT, TTL, WRITETIME, CAST, TOKEN
5. **Clause ordering**: Respects valid CQL clause ordering rules

### Features Fully Supported:

✅ **All core SELECT syntax** as specified in the CQL documentation
✅ **All selector types**: columns, terms, functions, casts, aggregates
✅ **All WHERE operators**: comparison, IN, CONTAINS, CONTAINS KEY
✅ **Complex queries**: Multiple joins with AND/OR, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
✅ **Performance features**: PER PARTITION LIMIT, ALLOW FILTERING
✅ **Output formats**: Standard, JSON, DISTINCT

### Limitations:

1. **Bind markers**: While executed correctly, tab completion doesn't suggest bind markers (`?`, `:name`)
2. **TOKEN() completion**: Basic support, could be enhanced for partition key suggestions
3. **User-defined functions**: Execution works, but tab completion doesn't fetch UDF names
4. **Tuple literals**: Execution works, but tab completion for tuple syntax is basic

### Conclusion:

**YES**, the SELECT statement syntax you specified is **fully supported** for execution. The implementation uses a pass-through approach that sends the complete query to Cassandra, ensuring all CQL SELECT features work correctly. Tab completion provides comprehensive support for most features, with some advanced features having basic or no completion support (but still executing correctly).
